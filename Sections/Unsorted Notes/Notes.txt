For H tags - You only want *1* h1 tag in a page. You may have more h2-h6 tags but only 1
H1 Tag.

While H tags do have a default size we are not using them for their size, the number
in the tag is what we use to navigate a web page. Never have an H tag X number without
the previous H tags used in the document. As in never have an H3 tag without first having
an H2 and H1 tag.

The <HTML> tag is the root element. Only allows the Head and Body tag. The Head tag should
include meta information, anything that does not show up on the page. The Body tag is the 
content portion of the page. The Title is used for links etc.

Auto format seems to be something I am going to be taking advantage of.
The majority of the first 4 hours of these lectures is largely review. I have pulled
some information from the lecture, seen above, but for the most part it has been difficult to 
maintain concentration, but I am managing. It is important to take in as much information
as I can.

While I am writing this in the notepad, I desperately want to develop a workflow
that will have this note document in my programming folder. When i actually need to write code
I will structure my files as such.


<span></span> is an inline way to section off something and then refer to it within the 
css
