<!--My Takeaways from this code along. This is incredibly simple. I am a little annoyed that it took almost 2 hours to get to this practice
    code along only for it to last 5 minutes but I do respect the teacher for being throrough. I would hate to think I am better than I am
or know more than I do only to find out my knowledge base is porous. I do have some notes/concerns/questions after completing this. First is
the img spacing issue is not something I would have intuitively known and I am glad I am seeing this now. Kaing handsome webpages at a glance
does not seem incredibly difficult but then again CSS/HTML is simply markup and I am not adding any logic or functions which I am sure
will complicate things. Additionally I am not worrying about hosting, data collect, security, or scalability which I am sure will be concerns.
Lastly, we made this website in a fairly simplistic way. My initial thought for the web design was to a nav, content, and footer sections to space
everything in. In the conent section having 3 divs, one for each artist, and then confining the art to those boxs which should have spanned
across the page, would have been best. But I dont know is this is the right way of doing things and Im getting ahead of myself, or if I'm on to
something. Either way time will tell.-->
