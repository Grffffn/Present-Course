So after learning yesterday the course I was following has not been updated in the slightest
since early 2018 I have made the tough decision to switch to a different instructor entirely.
The lack of polish, the hand holding, the lack of any explanation, and the total indifference
to the final version of the first instructors course did not sit well with me. I hate, despise,
having to switch again but my convictions have not changed. I will complete this course, as a whole
to develop a deeper 30,000 mile view of web development, which will allow me to, most likely poor,
enter the field and begin my journey. Possessing a high view of the field will let me hone in
my learning more specifically so that I may learn in a more pointed direction.

Additionally, I will be take notes as I learn throughout this course, which I will upload
along side any of my work. hopefully I can look back on this as a roadmap or documentation
if I get lost along the way or I want to explain my thinking in greater detail to another
individual or employer.
